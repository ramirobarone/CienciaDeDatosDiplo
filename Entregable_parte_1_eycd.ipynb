Tambien consideramos y entendemos que cada registro de la base puede tener un 'unique_id' para cada inmueble que puede ser considerado el campo 'Postcode', mientras que en la base airbnb_df ese campo seria 'zipcode', porque lo que podemos conectar ambas las fuentes considerando mediante estos campos.

On a sunny day, I prefer to stroll into the city - virtually a straight line down Bridge Road, past the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground, through the beautiful Fitzroy Gardens (home to Captain Cook's Cottage and the gorgeous Conservatory). It takes about 30-40 mins but is an excellent way to see Melbourne. The tram to St Kilda (which goes along the entirety of renowned shopper's delight Chapel Street) stops a 5-minute walk from our door, and the very cool Fitzroy and Collingwood neighbourhoods are just the other side of Victoria Street - a few kms away.

Be aware that if you have a full bore water pressure shower, the hot water will probably only last 10 minutes, which should be more than enough. Water restrictions have been very strict in Melbourne over the past decade but I would hope that my kind of guests are conscientious of water wastage regardless!

Easy walking distance to all points in the city as well as Southbank, Docklands, Carlton and Fitzroy. One of a kind laneway experience. Parties, events and gatherings of any kind are not permitted. One-of-a-kind warehouse conversion in an unbeatable city location for shoppers, foodies and culture lovers. See a video of this apartment on the Sydney Weekender website when it was featured by AirBnB. Search for AirBnB and Melbourne and it should come up. My apartment is located seconds from the official centre of Melbourne, yet it's in a quiet lane with excellent natural light. The centre of Melbourne is known for its many laneways which are full of smart bars, cool cafes, art galleries and some world class graffiti art. One of the nations' premier coffee houses, Brother Baba Budan (aka the cafe with the chairs hanging from the ceiling) is located on the corner of the laneway.",

There is no train service between the airport and the city but the Skybus leaves every 10 minutes and stops just 15 minutes walk away. Skybus offers a shuttle service to city hotels so if you don't feel like the walk tell them you're staying at City Garden Hotel on Little Bourke St which is just 50 metres from the apartment. Skybus tickets can be purchased online in advance which I recommend to avoid queuing. It's sad watching the bus leave while you're waiting to buy a ticket.",

Fitzroy has very diverse residents; shops; bars, cafes and restaurants; all services; and interesting streetscapes. There are beautiful parks and gardens nearby, plus museums and galleries. It's very walkable and bike friendly. Most buildings are low rise, one or two stories, even though its only ten minutes walk to the centre of the city. In the Guidebook I have listed a few on my favourite local places - though I'm sure you'll find your own just by wandering around. Sometimes these inner city neighbourhoods can be noisy, but the townhouse is in a street with very little through traffic. During the day there is some activity because the house borders an office and commercial precinct.",

There are two Myki cards (the local public transport smart card) for guest use (these need to be recharged in a local shop). There is no on site parking, but there is unrestricted street parking in front of the house. The main car rental offices are 20 minutes walk or 10 minutes taxi ride in the central city.   From the airport, if you are not coming by taxi, the Skybus takes you to Southern Cross Station in the city where you can transfer onto one of the three tram routes, which are one minute walk from the station.",

Plus the beach, with its kilometres of bike and walking paths meandering along the waterfront, is just a few steps from my front door.  But what makes my 'hood' a truly special place to stay...  Well, if you like a real neighbourhood, not just a location, you'll love Port. It's a friendly, bustling place where Vince the barista extraordinaire  learns what coffee you like and has it ready for you before you ask - folks say hi as you run (or stroll) along the beach - and neighbours drop by for a natter.

Stately mansions like Labassa and Grimwade House are a stones throw away.  The area is green and residential but a walk, a tram or a short drive away, is all the action of Balaclava, Ripponlea and Elsternwick. Stroll down Orrong Road to Glover Station, our favourite eatery in Glen Eira Road or to Ripponlea Village for a fabulous brunch.  Walk down the Balaclava Road hill to eclectic Balaclava with its cafes, restaurants, bakeries and shops.  And tram back up the hill if you are feeling lazy. The St Kilda Esplanade, Luna Park and Ackland Street are a short tram ride away on the no 16 or 3A trams. Enjoy the tram a little longer and you are in Melbourne's CBD on either the no 16, 3 or 3A.  (The no 3 takes you to the City via a different route to Ackland Street and St Kilda Beach) Alternatively you can take the train from Balaclava Station to the city or the MCG.

We invite guests of Satis Beach House and others to stay at our cute one bedroom apartment and live like a local in this fascinating suburb for a stay of four weeks or more.  \r\n\r\nAnyone who stays at Greyfriars for three months, may have two nights at Satis Beach House as our guests.

Love meeting people from all over the world and hearing about their lives and travels. Personal travel can be difficult sometimes but we manage to get away a couple of times a year. I lived in the US for 23 yrs so I travel there a lot to visit friends and family.\r\nLove being an AIRBNB host. Itry to keep my cottage and private suite in tip top condition with all the little necessities that I can think of to make your stay comfortable. I've lived in the area here in the Dandenong Ranges for 14 years and have a very extensive knowledge of what you should experience while here. There are lots of wonderful things to do and some fabulous restaurants too. I'll help you in any way I can. So come visit Belgrave.",

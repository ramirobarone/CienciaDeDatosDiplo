Located in East Brunswick, between High St, Northcote and Lygon St Brunswick you have the choice of some of Melbourne's best budget dining and cool bars. Restaurants range from cheap eateries to quality Lebanese and Turkish with Indian, Greek, Italian and Thai places.

Ceres has a daily organic foods market and two cafes with outdoor and indoor dining. They also have a bike shed where you can buy a second hand bike cheap - or take your own to work on.

The three strips are parallel - needless to say we have loads of great places to recommend - check out the Guidebook in the profile.

The tram to St Kilda (which goes along the entirety of renowned shopper's delight Chapel Street) stops a 5-minute walk from our door, and the very cool Fitzroy and Collingwood neighbourhoods are just the other side of Victoria Street - a few kms away.

Water restrictions have been very strict in Melbourne over the past decade but I would hope that my kind of guests are conscientious of water wastage regardless! All we ask is that you respect our home, as you would expect of visitors in your own home. Easy.

Diversity, cafes, boutiques, galleries, pubs, parks, restaurants, cocktail bars, music, street art = good vibes.",

I've left a local guide and map in your room and marked a square around the main Fitzroy streets as a start.

Hire a bike from one of the blue Melbourne Bike Share stations, the closest to us is opposite the wonderful Smith & Deli at 111 Moor Street, a 4 minute walk away.

         "Fitzroy is the oldest suburb in Melbourne and a great example of why Melbourne is regularly called the world's most livable city.  Fitzroy has very diverse residents; shops; bars, cafes and restaurants; all services; and interesting streetscapes. There are beautiful parks and gardens nearby, plus museums and galleries. It's very walkable and bike friendly. Most buildings are low rise, one or two stories, even though its only ten minutes walk to the centre of the city. In the Guidebook I have listed a few on my favourite local places - though I'm sure you'll find your own just by wandering around. Sometimes these inner city neighbourhoods can be noisy, but the townhouse is in a street with very little through traffic. During the day there is some activity because the house borders an office and commercial precinct.",

         "Public transport is excellent - three tram routes within a few minutes walk, and a CBD train station ten minutes walk to take you anywhere in the city. There are two Myki cards (the local public transport smart card) for guest use (these need to be recharged in a local shop). There is no on site parking, but there is unrestricted street parking in front of the house. The main car rental offices are 20 minutes walk or 10 minutes taxi ride in the central city.   From the airport, if you are not coming by taxi, the Skybus takes you to Southern Cross Station in the city where you can transfer onto one of the three tram routes, which are one minute walk from the station.",

         "Greyfriars is an iconic 1950s apartment block built near the top of East St Kilda hill.  Stately mansions like Labassa and Grimwade House are a stones throw away.  The area is green and residential but a walk, a tram or a short drive away, is all the action of Balaclava, Ripponlea and Elsternwick. Stroll down Orrong Road to Glover Station, our favourite eatery in Glen Eira Road or to Ripponlea Village for a fabulous brunch.  Walk down the Balaclava Road hill to eclectic Balaclava with its cafes, restaurants, bakeries and shops.  And tram back up the hill if you are feeling lazy. The St Kilda Esplanade, Luna Park and Ackland Street are a short tram ride away on the no 16 or 3A trams. Enjoy the tram a little longer and you are in Melbourne's CBD on either the no 16, 3 or 3A.  (The no 3 takes you to the City via a different route to Ackland Street and St Kilda Beach) Alternatively you can take the train from Balaclava Station to the city or the MCG. Feel like seeing a movie? Scoot along t",
         "If you are staying at Greyfriars for three months, we offer you a free two nights at Satis Beach House, Aireys Inlet to experience some surf coast sea air.",
         "The tram is just outside the apartment gardens.  Enjoy the rides! The 220 bus travels regularly up and down Orrong Road to the city and beyond via Malvern Road, South Yarra crossing Chapel Street to the Prahran Market. And we will leave a Myki card for you with a few dollars worth of transport. Just load it up at a newsagents to travel more on trams, buses and trains around Melbourne. Greenmeadows Gardens is around the corner and is a popular, leafy park for families and those just wanting to sit and read or walk their dogs.  Of course, Greyfriars has a lovely garden to relax in too. Markets on weekends like the famous St Kilda Esplanade Sunday Market and the Hank Marvin Markets in Alma Park are a weekend event with food trucks, produce and craft stalls. South Melbourne, Prahran and the famous Victoria Market in the city are all great places to buy fresh produce and to explore during the week too.",
         "The apartment is all yours and this includes the lovely garden with fresh herbs for picking, a communal laundry with washers and driers, large rubbish bins. The car park and garden are all accessible for your time here.  There is also plenty of free street parking just outside.",
         "You will have the apartment to yourselves.  We will meet you when you arrive to show you around and we are only an email or phone call away if you need us.  The other apartment owners are friendly and will help if needed.  We will also give you contact numbers for emergencies.",
         "We hope that you enjoy your time in our apartment and we are sure that you will treat it with respect. The apartment block is not a party block so noise including loud music after 10pm is to be avoided.  Only one or two people are allowed to stay and you are expected to treat Greyfriars with respect, of course. There is a large communal laundry with coin in the slot washers and driers that can be accessed most of the time.  Please see the information sheet.",

With Fitzroy's almost 100 cafes, restaurants, live music venues, cocktail bars and pubs you have chosen a wonderful area to stay in.  This is an award winning Kerstin Thompson house and has been my home for 16 years.  I love living here - I hope you'll enjoy visiting, it's nice to have you!",
         "Hi there, This listing is for one bedroom on the ground floor of my large 3 level home just off the wonderful Gertrude Street. (I have 2 rooms available - the other listing is 'Stunning Fitzroy own level+ensuite' listing #72576). ***Please not I only have 1 parking permit so please check it is available before booking, it usually is but it's definitely worth checking*** This is an excellent spot for guests in Melbourne for a short time who want that 'local feeling'.  Or for those lucky folk who are moving to Melbourne (nice choice!) it's a great landing pad while you look for something permanent. Located in between action-packed Brunswick and Smith Streets, this is a fantastic, diverse area full of great cafes, restaurants, wonderful local pubs, art galleries, parks, live music venues, diverse architecture and the Melbourne Museum.  The beloved #86 tram (our 'tramily') and #12 are just at the end of the road giving easy access to other parts of this wonderfully liveable city. The house",

         "One of Melbourne's smallest urban areas, Fitzroy, is a real treasure of old and new, working class and gentrification, historic preservation and modern architecture.  Right next to the city with both the Fitzroy and Carlton gardens in between, it's never boring but very relaxed.  If on the odd occasion it's noisy there are ear plugs in your bedside tables. Diversity, cafes, boutiques, galleries, pubs, parks, restaurants, cocktail bars, music, street art = good vibes.",
         "Please note the bed (an extremely comfortable queen) is against the wall on one side. It's a good idea to check Melbourne's weather report before you arrive, we really can have \"all seasons in 1 day\" so it's wise to bring something warm even for those summer nights.  I recommend the app 'Weatherzone'.  Help yourself to the umbrellas at the bottom of the stairs! Optus reception is not great in this room but other networks are good.",
         "There is so much to offer in Fitzroy you could spend most of your time getting around on foot.  I've left a local guide and map in your room and marked a square around the main Fitzroy streets as a start. The 86 or 112 trams go straight into the city in about 10 minutes, they run so regularly you don't even need a timetable. Hire a bike from one of the blue Melbourne Bike Share stations, the closest to us is opposite the wonderful Smith & Deli at 111 Moor Street, a 4 minute walk away. Taxi or Uber Or if you have a car my Visitor's Parking Permit might be available - first in first served!",
         "Level 1 - your room, your own toilet, laundry, share bathroom, front door access Level 2 - shared dining room, lounge, kitchen & 2 large balconies (Level 3 is the other guest area of bedroom, bathroom, wee balcony & study)",
         "This is a very independent set up.  Apart from our rooms on level 1 there is another guest room on level 3.   As we are all usually out and about enjoying Melbourne it can be rare we run into each other but I'm always contactable on my phone :)",
         "- Please call out 'h!' or 'bye' when you use the front door, it's nice to know who's around.  If you're uncomfortable doing this, please don't book! - Please ensure the front door is always locked and gently used - The house is just for myself, my personal guests and my Airbnb guests - It's ok to use the kitchen but not ok to bring home Cage Eggs - The records, the alcohol and the kitchen cabinets with rubber bands on them are just for my personal use - Please respect the check-in and check-out times, thank you :)",

Without the permit, it is only free 2hr parking. But honestly, parking inspectors and very very rare in our street!! So if you have a second car, it’s highly unlikely you will get fined. But if you wish to play it safe, there is free parking in the area, just a bit further to walk!",

Ie) A booking for 1 - 2 guests will give you access to 1 bedroom, a booking for 3-4 guests will give you access to 2 bedrooms, and a booking of 5-7 guests will give you access to all 3 bedrooms. A booking for 8-10 guests will enable you use of the sofa beds also.",

Water restrictions have been very strict in Melbourne over the past decade but I would hope that my kind of guests are conscientious of water wastage regardless!

I took my time acquiring a double degree in International Business/Japanese and am now kept pretty busy directing a charity that I founded in 2013. I have lived in lots of different cities around the world and experienced a host of very different living arrangements (pun always intended), so I was pretty well accustomed to this gig before Airbnb even existed.\r\n\r\nI like to run, travel, appreciate art, shop, wine, dine, learn Spanish (my wife is Mexican) and love a good board game. I get my kicks from real-life auctions, discovering exotic fruits and vegetables at my weekend farmers market, and meeting interesting people.",

I am privileged to have traveled to many corners of the globe, including, Africa, USA, Canada, Europe, UK, the Pacific, NZ, Australia, South America and Asia.\r\n\r\nMy Interests include cycling, sailing, swimming, horse riding, physical well \r\nbeing, cooking, meeting people, good conversation over a wine.\r\nConsider myself to be friendly, social, sense of humor, independent, adaptable, well organised and tidy.\r\nLove exchanging travel stories, ideas and meeting people of different cultures. My purpose for traveling is to experience varying cultures, hopefully improve my tolerance, knowledge and grow as an individual from the experience and fortunate to have volunteered in Brazil and South Africa \r\n\r\nAs a Host and guest, I appreciate what I would like to get out of using and hosting with Air BnB.\r\n\r\nI will be very happy to sit down over a glass of wine to provide advise on what to see and do while in Melbourne , Australia and of course beautiful New Zealand! \r\nIf guests want minimal interaction I am happy to leave them to their own devises and independence or interact as much as required.\r\n\r\nYesterday is history, today is a gift, tomorrow may never come - so enjoy each moment :)",

Hire a bike from one of the blue Melbourne Bike Share stations, the closest to us is opposite the wonderful Smith & Deli at 111 Moor Street, a 4 minute walk away.

         "Fitzroy is the oldest suburb in Melbourne and a great example of why Melbourne is regularly called the world's most livable city.  Fitzroy has very diverse residents; shops; bars, cafes and restaurants; all services; and interesting streetscapes. There are beautiful parks and gardens nearby, plus museums and galleries. It's very walkable and bike friendly. Most buildings are low rise, one or two stories, even though its only ten minutes walk to the centre of the city. In the Guidebook I have listed a few on my favourite local places - though I'm sure you'll find your own just by wandering around. Sometimes these inner city neighbourhoods can be noisy, but the townhouse is in a street with very little through traffic. During the day there is some activity because the house borders an office and commercial precinct.",

         "Public transport is excellent - three tram routes within a few minutes walk, and a CBD train station ten minutes walk to take you anywhere in the city. There are two Myki cards (the local public transport smart card) for guest use (these need to be recharged in a local shop). There is no on site parking, but there is unrestricted street parking in front of the house. The main car rental offices are 20 minutes walk or 10 minutes taxi ride in the central city.   From the airport, if you are not coming by taxi, the Skybus takes you to Southern Cross Station in the city where you can transfer onto one of the three tram routes, which are one minute walk from the station.",

It's a friendly, bustling place where Vince the barista extraordinaire  learns what coffee you like and has it ready for you before you ask - folks say hi as you run (or stroll) along the beach - and neighbours drop by for a natter.

         "Greyfriars is an iconic 1950s apartment block built near the top of East St Kilda hill.  Stately mansions like Labassa and Grimwade House are a stones throw away.  The area is green and residential but a walk, a tram or a short drive away, is all the action of Balaclava, Ripponlea and Elsternwick. Stroll down Orrong Road to Glover Station, our favourite eatery in Glen Eira Road or to Ripponlea Village for a fabulous brunch.  Walk down the Balaclava Road hill to eclectic Balaclava with its cafes, restaurants, bakeries and shops.  And tram back up the hill if you are feeling lazy. The St Kilda Esplanade, Luna Park and Ackland Street are a short tram ride away on the no 16 or 3A trams. Enjoy the tram a little longer and you are in Melbourne's CBD on either the no 16, 3 or 3A.  (The no 3 takes you to the City via a different route to Ackland Street and St Kilda Beach) Alternatively you can take the train from Balaclava Station to the city or the MCG.

         "If you are staying at Greyfriars for three months, we offer you a free two nights at Satis Beach House, Aireys Inlet to experience some surf coast sea air.",
         "The tram is just outside the apartment gardens.  Enjoy the rides! The 220 bus travels regularly up and down Orrong Road to the city and beyond via Malvern Road, South Yarra crossing Chapel Street to the Prahran Market. And we will leave a Myki card for you with a few dollars worth of transport. Just load it up at a newsagents to travel more on trams, buses and trains around Melbourne. Greenmeadows Gardens is around the corner and is a popular, leafy park for families and those just wanting to sit and read or walk their dogs.  Of course, Greyfriars has a lovely garden to relax in too. Markets on weekends like the famous St Kilda Esplanade Sunday Market and the Hank Marvin Markets in Alma Park are a weekend event with food trucks, produce and craft stalls. South Melbourne, Prahran and the famous Victoria Market in the city are all great places to buy fresh produce and to explore during the week too.",
         "The apartment is all yours and this includes the lovely garden with fresh herbs for picking, a communal laundry with washers and driers, large rubbish bins. The car park and garden are all accessible for your time here.  There is also plenty of free street parking just outside.",
         "You will have the apartment to yourselves.  We will meet you when you arrive to show you around and we are only an email or phone call away if you need us.  The other apartment owners are friendly and will help if needed.  We will also give you contact numbers for emergencies.",
         "We hope that you enjoy your time in our apartment and we are sure that you will treat it with respect. The apartment block is not a party block so noise including loud music after 10pm is to be avoided.  Only one or two people are allowed to stay and you are expected to treat Greyfriars with respect, of course. There is a large communal laundry with coin in the slot washers and driers that can be accessed most of the time.  Please see the information sheet.",

Or for those lucky folk who are moving to Melbourne (nice choice!) it's a great landing pad while you look for something permanent. Located in between action-packed Brunswick and Smith Streets, this is a fantastic, diverse area full of great cafes, restaurants, wonderful local pubs, art galleries, parks, live music venues, diverse architecture and the Melbourne Museum.

Right next to the city with both the Fitzroy and Carlton gardens in between, it's never boring but very relaxed.  If on the odd occasion it's noisy there are ear plugs in your bedside tables. Diversity, cafes, boutiques, galleries, pubs, parks, restaurants, cocktail bars, music, street art = good vibes.",

It's a good idea to check Melbourne's weather report before you arrive, we really can have \"all seasons in 1 day\" so it's wise to bring something warm even for those summer nights.  I recommend the app 'Weatherzone'.  Help yourself to the umbrellas at the bottom of the stairs! Optus reception is not great in this room but other networks are good.",

I've left a local guide and map in your room and marked a square around the main Fitzroy streets as a start. The 86 or 112 trams go straight into the city in about 10 minutes, they run so regularly you don't even need a timetable. Hire a bike from one of the blue Melbourne Bike Share stations, the closest to us is opposite the wonderful Smith & Deli at 111 Moor Street, a 4 minute walk away. Taxi or Uber Or if you have a car my Visitor's Parking Permit might be available - first in first served!",

         "This is a very independent set up.  Apart from our rooms on level 1 there is another guest room on level 3.   As we are all usually out and about enjoying Melbourne it can be rare we run into each other but I'm always contactable on my phone :)",
         "- Please call out 'h!' or 'bye' when you use the front door, it's nice to know who's around.  If you're uncomfortable doing this, please don't book! - Please ensure the front door is always locked and gently used - The house is just for myself, my personal guests and my Airbnb guests - It's ok to use the kitchen but not ok to bring home Cage Eggs - The records, the alcohol and the kitchen cabinets with rubber bands on them are just for my personal use - Please respect the check-in and check-out times, thank you :)",
